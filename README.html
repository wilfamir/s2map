s2map is a simple geo visualizer <br/>
<a href="https://github.com/blackmad/s2map">source code on gitbhub</a>

</p>

I find I have one or more lat/lngs, and I want to put them on a map and not worry about formatting, writing a file, etc, so I just paste it into s2map.com

<ul>

<li>
<a href="http://cl.ly/image/1n2o1p0Y2e0A">
example of pasting in a bounding box from some json
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://s2map.com/#40.74,-74,40.75,-74.05">
using it via url params (doesn't support all the options yet)
</a>
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://cl.ly/image/1s12263h0X3r">
rendering some geojson coordinates in lng/lat format
</a>
</li>

</ul>

I'm curious if other people find this useful or have feature suggestions.

oh, and just for kicks alt/ctrl/meta+click pops up a balloon with lat/lng info

Additionally, s2map demonstrates the power of google's s2 (spherical geometry library) available for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/s2-geometry-library/">C++</a> (which doesn't compile publicly, the version in <a href="https://github.com/blackmad/s2map">my github repo</a> does) and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/s2-geometry-library-java/">java</a> (in extensive use at <a href="http://foursquare.com">foursquare</a>). We use it as a very robust geohashing library with a number of great properties (skip-level indexing, prefix parents). Read the code, it's beautiful and well documented and a pretty good intro to the concepts.
